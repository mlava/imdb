This extension allows you to search and import metadata for films or tv series from the IMDb. 

You will need to get an API key from [omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and insert it in the Roam Depot configuration panel.

You can trigger the extension via the Command Palette or via SmartBlocks using <%IMDB%>.

The extension will retrieve the page title, search IMDb for that title and then present a list of matching films or tv series. After you select one, it will import the poster and metadata, formatted nicely using Roam Research conventions.
